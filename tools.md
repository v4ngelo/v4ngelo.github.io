#### Visual Studio Code
<div class="tools-text">
    This is my go-to IDE when working with frontend frameworks.
    A lot of plugins to personalize, all the configurations you
    need and IntelliSense. It's free! Love it.
</div>

<img class ="tools-images" src="/img/pycharm.png">
#### PyCharm
<div class="tools-text">
    Likewise, whenever I'm working on a Python project, I always
    use PyCharm. Paid. They offer free licenses if you're a
    student.
</div>
<br/>

<img class ="tools-images" src="/img/intellij.png">
#### IntelliJ Idea
<div class="tools-text">
    Similarly, with Java I think no one beats IntelliJ. It has
    a nice support for Spring + Hibernate (frameworks I used a LOT)
    and a some other plugins that rock. Downside, it's paid =(
</div>

<img class ="tools-images" src="/img/postman.png">
#### Postman
<div class="tools-text">
    A free tool that allows you to store all your requests,
    ordered, in a single place. Awesome when testing APIs.
</div>
