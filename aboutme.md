Hi! My name is Anabella. You might want to know some things about me:

- I love sushi. And food. And cooking experiments (getting the kitchen dirty, yay!)
- I adore my family, friends & pets
- I take spinning classes 3 times a week in the early morning. The rest? I can be boxing, playing tennis/soccer or going to the park for a walk/run
- I like to travel, and I'm always planning the next trip
- I'm a fan of Jocko Willink, his [podcast](http://jockopodcast.com/) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2)

### my history
At seventeen, I moved from my hometown to La Plata for studying. Here, I found my profession and 
lots of friends.

Now I rock with my teammates at [uBiome](https://ubiome.com/)
