7 Hi! My name is Anabella. You might want to know some things about me:
8
9 - I love sushi. And food. And cooking experiments (getting the kitchen dirty, yay!)
10 - I adore my family, friends, and pets
11 - I take spinning classes 3 times a week in the early morning.​ The rest? I can be boxing, playing tennis or going to the park for a walk/run.
12 - I like to travel, and I'm always planning the next trip.
13 - I'm quiet, I don't panic easily and I hate drama.

At seventeen, I moved from my hometown to La Plata, for studying. Here, I found my profession and 
lots of friends.

Now I rock with my teammates at ubiome.com
