Hi! My name is Anabella. You might want to know some things about me:

- I love sushi. And food. And cooking experiments (getting the kitchen dirty, yay!)
- I adore my family, friends, and pets
- I take spinning classes 3 times a week in the early morning.â€‹ The rest? I can be boxing, playing tennis or going to the park for a walk/run.
- I like to travel, and I'm always planning the next trip.
- I'm quiet, I don't panic easily and I hate drama.

### my history
At seventeen, I moved from my hometown to La Plata, for studying. Here, I found my profession and 
lots of friends.

Now I rock with my teammates at ubiome.com
