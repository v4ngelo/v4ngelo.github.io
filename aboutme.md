Hi! My name is Anabella. You might want to know some things about me:

- I love sushi. And food. And cooking experiments (getting the kitchen dirty, yay!)
- I adore my family, friends & pets
- I make beer, and cheese
- I like to travel, and I'm always planning the next trip

### my history

At seventeen, I moved from my hometown to La Plata for studying. Here, I found my profession and
lots of friends.

Now I rock with my teammates at [uBiome](https://ubiome.com/)
